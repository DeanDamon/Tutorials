# GitHub

## What is it?

GitHub is a hosting plataform for software development and version control (*via* git). 

For us, GitHub serves as place where all useful code is stored. Well, why not just use Google Drive or the likes? GitHub provides us with version control (git), with which we can keep track of the modifications made to our code over time. Moreover, it allow us to collaborate on the same project helping us, for example, to deal with conflicts arising from a common file being modified by two people. 

The best way to learn git is working with git, but I am try to give you some useful tips to get started.
