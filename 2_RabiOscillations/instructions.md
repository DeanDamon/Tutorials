# Two-level system under a time-dependent potential

Consider a quantum system consisting of two energy levels $|a\rangle$ and $|b\rangle$ with energy gap $\hbar \omega_{ba} = E_b - E_a$. Initially, these energy levels correspond to eigenstates of an unperturbed Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_0$. These states are coupled upon the inclusion of a time dependent perturbation, $\hat{V}(t)$, with a coupling strength of

$V_{ab}(t) = \langle a | \hat{V}(t) | b \rangle$
